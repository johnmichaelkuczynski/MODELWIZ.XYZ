Founder ownership and greenshoe are working now—good fix.

Still looks off:

68% peer discount is extreme — CrowdStrike trades at 18x, Zscaler 14x, SentinelOne 8x. A 55%-growth cybersecurity company pricing at 3.9x is implausible. The model seems to be ignoring the peer comps and anchoring entirely on DCF.
Negative Day-1 pop recommendation — No bank would file at 103% of DCF expecting -3% aftermarket. Standard practice is pricing 10-15% below fair value to ensure a pop. The logic appears inverted.
Proceeds exceeded target — Input requested $550M primary, output shows $633M. The greenshoe shouldn't inflate the primary target—it should be additive on top of hitting $550M base.
Suggested logic check:

DCF should set a ceiling, not the target
Peer multiples should inform the base case
Price at ~85-90% of lower bound of (DCF, peer-derived value) for healthy pop
Greenshoe = 15% × primary shares, additive to base proceeds
