- Still 16% below DCF → clear bargain for long-term believers
- Clears the book at 28× with only the highest-quality specialist healthcare investors
- Board’s “clean, orderly aftermarket” goal fully satisfied
- Post-IPO cash gives >5 years runway → no secondary overhang risk

File amendment at $19–$20 tonight, price at $20 tomorrow morning.What the model said,What it should have said,Why it’s catastrophically wrong
Recommended $19–$20,Should have been $30–$32,The order book showed 28× at $32+ with every single top-tier healthcare fund maxed out. Pricing at $20 is leaving $800M+ on the table for no reason
Implied first-day pop ~76%,Correct expectation is 45–55% for biotech,You used SaaS pop precedent on a biotech. Biotech pops are structurally higher because of scarcity and specialist demand
Oversubscription numbers basically flat 66–70×,Should have dropped sharply above $32,"The real book was 59× at $28+, 41× at $30+, 28× at $32+. Your model hallucinated constant demand"
Founder ownership stuck at 29.5%,Should decline from ~35.2% to 34.4% as price rises,Simple dilution math error
Gross proceeds wrong at lower prices,"$18 would only raise $378M, not $420M",The offering is fixed shares (21M + 3.15M greenshoe). Proceeds scale linearly with price
Used NTM EV/Revenue multiple,"Biotech is priced on 2030 risk-adjusted revenue, not NTM",This is the single biggest red flag. No biotech banker in 2025 uses NTM revenue multiples for a pre-commercial name
