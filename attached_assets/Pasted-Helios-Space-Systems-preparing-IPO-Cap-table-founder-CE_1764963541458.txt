Let me analyze what's working and what's still broken.
What's working now:

Positive Day-1 pop (+17%) - this is good, pricing below DCF
Greenshoe is now additive ($60M on top of $400M base)
Secondary proceeds correctly calculated ($75M)
DCF ceiling logic is being applied (peer-derived $24.11 capped to DCF $15.27)
Proceeds breakdown is cleaner

What's still broken:

Founder Ownership Post-IPO: 0.0% — The input clearly states founder CEO holds 38M shares, CTO holds 22M shares = 60M founder shares total. Post-IPO FD shares = 134.38M. So founders should own 60M / 134.38M = ~44.7%, not 0.0%
The user specifically asked to "Show sensitivity on founder control threshold at 50%" - this wasn't addressed
The pricing matrix only shows 3 price points ($12, $13, $14) which is a narrow range

The founder ownership bug is still there from before. This is a significant issue.Major improvement—Day-1 pop is now positive, greenshoe is additive, proceeds logic is correct.
Still broken:

Founder Ownership = 0.0% — Input explicitly states CEO holds 38M shares, CTO holds 22M shares (60M total). With 134.38M FD shares post-IPO, founders should own ~44.6%, not 0.0%. This bug persists from earlier tests.
50% control threshold analysis missing — Input requested sensitivity on founder control at 50%. Model didn't address it. At 44.6% founders would lose majority control—this should trigger a warning or show what price/dilution combo preserves 50%+.
Narrow pricing matrix — Only 3 price points ($12-$14). Earlier outputs showed 6. Inconsistent behavior.


The founder calc is likely:

Not summing multiple founder entries (CEO + CTO)
Or not carrying pre-IPO shares through to post-IPO calc
Or defaulting to 0 when "founder" keyword isn't exact match

Check if your parser handles "founder CEO holds X, co-founder CTO holds Y" as two additive founder buckets.
