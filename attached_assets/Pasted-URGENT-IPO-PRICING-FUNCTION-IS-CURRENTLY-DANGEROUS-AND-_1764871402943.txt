URGENT – IPO PRICING FUNCTION IS CURRENTLY DANGEROUS AND UNUSABLE

It just priced a screaming-hot biotech IPO at $20 when the real order book had 28× oversubscribed at $32+ with every single top-tier healthcare fund (Fidelity, RA Capital, Orbimed, Redmile, Wellington) maxed out. That is not a small error – that is a career-ending, mandate-losing, $800M-left-on-the-table catastrophe.

Here are the exact bugs that must be fixed immediately, in this order:

1. Order-book parsing is completely broken  
   The model is ignoring the actual demand numbers in the prompt and hallucinating flat oversubscription.  
   FIX: Parse lines like “$32 and above: 28× oversubscribed” literally and drop the oversubscription column exactly at those price levels. Never smooth or invent numbers.

2. Wrong valuation metric for biotech  
   It used NTM EV/Revenue (SaaS metric) instead of 2030 risk-adjusted revenue multiple (the only metric that matters for pre-commercial biotech).  
   FIX: Detect sector (biotech, SaaS, fintech, etc.) and automatically switch to the correct benchmark (2030 rNPV for biotech, NTM revenue for SaaS, etc.).

3. Gross proceeds calculation is wrong  
   Offering is fixed shares (21M primary + 3.15M greenshoe). Proceeds = price × total shares sold.  
   FIX: Never show $378M at $18. It must be exactly $420M at $20.00 and scale linearly.

4. Founder/employee ownership stuck at 29.5% across all prices  
   FIX: Ownership must decline as price rises (higher valuation = more dilution for same shares sold).

5. Historical pop precedent is wrong  
   It used generic 76% average instead of biotech-specific ~45–55% responsible pop (or 80–100%+ when they deliberately underprice).  
   FIX: Use sector-specific first-day pop history and respect board guidance (“clean, orderly aftermarket” = lower pop).

6. Recommendation logic is inverted  
   It picked the lowest responsible price instead of the highest responsible price that still leaves an acceptable pop.  
   FIX: Default rule = push to the absolute highest price the book will bear while keeping expected first-day pop ≤ 60% (unless board explicitly wants a moonshot).

Re-test with this EXACT prompt (do not change a single word) until the output is materially identical to the correct version I gave earlier ($30–$32 range, $32 clearing price).
