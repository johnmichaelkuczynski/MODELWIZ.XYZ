IPO PRICING APP; I NEED YOU TO VERIFY THAT ITS OUTPUT IS GOOD RELATIVE TO ITS INPUT. HERE IS THE INPUT:
Helios Space Systems preparing IPO. Cap table: founder CEO holds 38 million shares, co-founder CTO holds 22 million shares, Sequoia owns 18 million shares, Founders Fund owns 12 million shares, unexercised options 9 million shares. Revenue $185 million growing 72% year one, 58% year two, 40% year three, 28% years four and five. Terminal growth 4%. Gross margin 54%, EBITDA margin negative 22% currently improving to positive 14% by year five. Heavy R&D spend at 48% of revenue declining to 28%. CapEx 12% due to manufacturing, NWC 11%. Tax 21%, WACC 14.5%. Comps: Rocket Lab trades at 8x revenue, Intuitive Machines at 6x, Redwire at 4x, Axon at 11x for crossover. Target primary raise $400 million, Sequoia selling $75 million secondary. Include 15% greenshoe. Model is currently EBITDA negative so weight revenue multiples heavily. Show sensitivity on founder control threshold at 50%.

The IPO app’s output has several internal inconsistencies versus the input and would not be “good” as-is; mechanically some parts line up, but the founder control and share-count math are clearly wrong, and some DCF vs. multiples choices look questionable for a still‑loss‑making business.

Check of share counts and ownership
From the input, pre‑IPO fully diluted shares are 99M (38M + 22M + 18M + 12M + 9M options). The output says post‑IPO FD shares are 134.38M and total shares sold (primary + secondary + greenshoe) are 41.15M at the mid‑price. That implies a pre‑IPO FD base of about 93.2M (134.38 – 41.15), not 99M, so the model has either dropped or misstated some existing equity. That alone is a red flag because it changes dilution, market cap, and founder control thresholds.

The input asks for sensitivity on a 50% founder control threshold, but the output simply states “Founders retain 0.0% post‑IPO” at all price points. That is implausible given 60M founder shares (38M + 22M) against 99M FD pre‑IPO; even with 30.77M primary plus 4.62M greenshoe and 5.77M secondary, founders should still own a meaningful percentage unless the model is overwriting their ownership or treating all primary as coming from them. The 0.0% founder ownership output is almost certainly a logic error in the app, and it completely fails the requested 50% control sensitivity.

Proceeds and valuation mechanics
The proceeds block is roughly self‑consistent: at $13, 41.15M shares sold gives $535M gross, which decomposes cleanly into $400M base primary, $60M greenshoe, and $75M secondary, matching the stated 15% greenshoe and the target raise. That structure is in line with typical IPO mechanics where primary is set by capital needs, secondary by selling shareholders, and greenshoe at roughly 15% of the base offering.

Using a post‑IPO FD share count of 134.38M and a $13 offer price gives an equity value around $1.7B, and subtracting roughly $460M in net cash (primary + greenshoe net of fees) to get a $1.3B enterprise value is in the right ballpark for an early‑stage space hardware/services company given the comps you listed (4–11× revenue). The NTM EV/Revenue of about 4.0× versus a 7.5× peer median, plus an 85% of DCF “discount,” is directionally coherent for a loss‑making issuer being priced below high‑growth peers.

DCF vs. peers and pricing choice
The output uses a DCF fair value of $15.27/share as a “ceiling” and caps the peer‑derived $24.11/share at that level, effectively choosing a conservative price band of $12–$14 and recommending $13. That structure (peer‑implied upside capped by DCF, then applying an IPO discount to DCF to set the offer) is a defensible framework for an issuer with strong revenue growth but negative EBITDA.

However, there are two concerns:

The model headline says “Model is currently EBITDA negative so weight revenue multiples heavily,” but then constrains everything off the DCF ceiling and ends up materially below the peer revenue multiple range (3.7–4.4× vs 7.5× median). That is internally contradictory to the stated weighting.

The “growth deceleration penalty” and “85% of fair value” discount are presented as precise but are not tied back to the specific cash‑flow profile you gave (72% → 58% → 40% → 28% growth, improving EBITDA margins, heavy R&D and capex). Without a clear bridge from those operating inputs to the 19.4% penalty and 85% discount, those adjustments are opaque and could be arbitrary.

Founder control sensitivity
The app was explicitly asked to “show sensitivity on founder control threshold at 50%.” With 60M founder shares and 99M FD pre‑IPO, founders begin at about 61% ownership. To stay above 50%, total post‑IPO FD shares would need to be capped so that founder shares remain at least half of the total. Under the app’s mid‑case 134.38M FD, founders would be down in the mid‑40s% range, not 0%, and a proper sensitivity table should show:

Maximum primary + greenshoe that preserves 50% control

Trade‑off between proceeds and control at $12, $13, $14

Whether reducing secondary or reallocating selling between founders and funds can maintain the threshold

Because the model outputs 0.0% founder ownership and no sensitivity rows, it has not satisfied this requirement at all.

Overall verdict
Numerically, the proceeds split, basic valuation math, and a $13 price at ~4× revenue with a 15–20% expected day‑1 pop look broadly reasonable for a high‑growth, EBITDA‑negative space company relative to the comp set.

Structurally and logically, the app’s treatment of the cap table and founder ownership is incorrect, the pre‑ vs post‑FD share math does not align with the input, and the requested 50% founder control sensitivity is missing.

Conceptually, the model says it will emphasize revenue multiples for a negative‑EBITDA issuer but then constrains pricing to an opaque DCF ceiling and applies additional discounts and penalties without a transparent link to the forecast.

For those reasons, the output is not “good relative to its input” and should not be relied on without fixing the ownership logic, reconciling the share count and dilution to the provided cap table, and making the DCF vs. peer‑multiple weighting and founder‑control sensitivity explicit.
